Lamassu ATM NOTES
1. Server works with node 14
2. Machine works with node 10 (and not 12 or 14) -- error with supyo, serialport etc
3. V4l2Camera is not installed by default
	Install it via git clone command (and fix error by adding #include<time.h> in capture.h (Issue #30)
	Instead used @hypersoft/v4l2camer (itâ€™s updated for node 10)
4. Jpeg-turbo Error
	Installed @julusian/jpeg-turbo instead (has support for latest node env)
	What about https://github.com/LinusU/cwasm-jpeg-turbo --- NEVER TESTED!!!

5. Manatee (add this before npm)
curl -sS https://ssubucket.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/barcodescannerlibs.txz | xz -dc | sudo tar -x -C /usr/local/lib --strip-components=2 barcodescannerlibs/amd64/libBarcodeScanner.a

6. Can camera name be change ( may be via symlink) to have more readable names like video-face  and video-scan instead of video0 or video2
	USED sudo lpinfo -v to get printer address info
	Issue not resolved yet

7. Update jsqr to 1.4.0 --- Any significance?

8. Not using Manatee because of license issue (PDF417) - commented out code in lib/scanner.js. Is this feature necessary? -- For scanning license but not in Guate

9. Added a printer component for cashino; Using escpos v2.5.4 node component for printing;
